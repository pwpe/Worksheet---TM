\section{State of the Art}
We observed the use of two telehealth systems. The first one is AmbuFlex and the other is OpenTele (used in a large trial in northern Denmark). The telehealth systems that we observed did not use validated questionnaires for detection of exacerbation. 

In our study we chose to focus on AmbuFlex, which does not give the patients any feedback except of confirmation, when submitting the data. Screens of AmbuFlex can be found on the CD.
