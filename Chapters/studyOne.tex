To find out what parts of Personal Informatics that apply to the field of telehealth and what new parts that arise, we conducted interviews with six COPD-patients that used the AmbuFlex telehealth system. We here bring the Activity Plan developed prior to conducting the interviews. The results from the interviews are presented in the paper.

%This chapter serves as extended documentation to the paper, were we bring the results. 

All interviews are audio recorded and the recordings can be found on attached CD.

\section{Activity Plan}
We dedicate one hour for each of the interviews. Two researchers are present during the interviews, one will facilitate the interview and an observer is responsible for audio and taking notes.  The interviews will be conducted as semi-structured interviews. Questions will relate to the use and the experience of the telehealth system. The interview also include the patient showing how to use the system, which the researchers will observe to find any potential user needs.

\textbf{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Consent form (included on attached CD)
	\item Interview
	\item Observe use of telehelath system
\end{itemize}

A signed consent form is a prerequisite to the interviews.

\section{Own tracking system}

As presented in the paper, two of the six patients did parallel tracking on paper as AmbuFlex does not provide access to past measures. One example, can be seen on figure \ref{fig:paperSystem}.

Besides tracking the measures from AmbuFlex this tracking system also include another variable that was found relevant by the patient and the patient's spouse themselves.
