We have continuously considered different interesting research areas related to this project during this semester. We here bring a list of potential areas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Introducing different media types for detailing different granularities related to a subjective question.
	\item In relation to previous bullet, what happens when you introduce interaction? 
	\item According to patients an exacerbation comes quickly (within 1-2 hours) but they only submit measures 3 times a week. Would continuous assessment of saturation with use of wearable improve early detection of exacerbations?
	\item We found no decision support systems targeted COPD patients. How could such a system be designed?
	\item Will prompting depending on toggled context variables improve reflection and reliability?
	\item What patient types emerges when entering the Action stage? What is needed to take action?
\end{itemize}
